subprocess runs a download script.
    This script will use multiprocessing to download all files at the same time.
    - Or at least up to a specific bandwidth - maybe 30 files at a time.
    
    All files are saved into a directory. /MP4 Files

subprocess runs a conversion script.
    Created a directory that houses wav files for transcription.
    Goes into the output directory for the downloads, and uses multiprocessing
    to convert all MP4 files to WAV files with the same name. possibly librosa, ffmpeg - whatever is fastest.

the next part of the script will do the following in a loop till all files are processed.

    Creates a que system for GPU allocation.
    Specifications
    GPUs = 4 x A100 80GB 
    Each job = 10GB
    Number of Jobs per GPU = 8
    Number of GPUs = 4 
    Total Jobs at one time = 32
    
    Loop will allocate each job to the spare jobs spots when a job has finished.

    Before makeing the subprocess.run for the job, a directory folder within a destination will be named 
    the same as the WAV file being processed.

    The subprocess will output to this folder.

    this will check every 500ms - but does not need to log. 

    Once all files have been processed a cleenup script will move all original MP4 files and the WAVS to the
    folder containing the outputs of the subprocess.
